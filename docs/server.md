# Server Documentation

Woole allows the creation of custom servers. Before setting up a Woole Server, ensure that the necessary ports (HTTP, HTTPS, and Tunnel) are open and properly configured in the firewall, if applicable. Refer to the server providerâ€™s documentation for specific configuration instructions.

Please note that domains and hosting services are not included with Woole Server.

## Basic Usage

```sh
./woole-server 
```

Output:
```
===============
   HTTP listening on http://{client}.mywebsite.com
  HTTPS listening on https://{client}.mywebsite.com
 Tunnel listening on grpc://mywebsite.com:9653
===============
```

*To provide an HTTPS server, the server must be certified. Consult the [Using HTTPS](#using-https) section for more details.*

## Available Options

| Option                      | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-pattern`                  | Set the server hostname pattern. Example: `{client}.mysite.com`             |
| `-http`                     | Port on which the server listens for HTTP requests (default `80`)           |
| `-https`                    | Port on which the server listens for HTTPS requests (default `443`)         |
| `-tunnel`                   | Port on which the gRPC tunnel listens (default `9653`)                      |
| `-seed`                     | Key used to hash the client bearer                                          |
| `-tls-cert`                 | Path to the TLS certificate or fullchain file                               |
| `-tls-key`                  | Path to the TLS private key file                                            |
| `-shared-key`               | Path to the shared key used to authenticate the client. (Default: disabled) |
| `-log-level`                | Level of detail for the logs to be displayed (default `INFO`)               |
| `-log-remote-addr`          | Log the request remote address                                              |
| `-tunnel-reconnect-timeout` | Timeout to reconnect the stream when the connection is lost. [Duration format](special-types.md#duration-format) (default `10s`) |
| `-tunnel-request-size`      | Tunnel maximum request size. [Size format](special-types.md#size-format) (default `2GB`, limited by gRPC)  |
| `-tunnel-response-size`     | Tunnel maximum response size. [Size format](special-types.md#size-format) (default `2GB`, limited by gRPC) |
| `-tunnel-response-timeout`  | Timeout to receive a client response. [Duration format](special-types.md#duration-format) (default `10s`)  |
| `-tunnel-connection-timeout`| Timeout for client connections. [Duration format](special-types.md#duration-format) (default `unset`)      |

## Hostname Pattern

The `pattern` is used to define the host format and where the [Client ID](client.md#client-id) will be displayed in the URL. Example, `{client}.pattern.here` will generate URLs such as:
- https://clientid.pattern.here;
- https://test.pattern.here
- https://l2rhwi87aira.pattern.here;

*If using a host, configure it to allow the `*.pattern.here` DNS records.*

### Custom URL Rules

The [Client ID](client.md#client-id) will be used for the first attached tunnel and the subsequents will be appended with a 5 digits hash. The [Client ID](client.md#client-id) will become available again once the tunnel dettach.

If no name is provided, an 8 digits hash will be returned instead.

### Example

Using the server pattern "https://{client}.pattern.here" and the [Client ID](client.md#client-id) `test` will return the following URL:
- https://test.pattern.here, if the name test is not in use right now OR
- https://test-3ld8f.pattern.here, with a 5 digits hash.

Otherwise, if the name is not provided, an 8 digits hash will be used instead:
- https://2hv9e4lf.pattern.here

## Using HTTPS

The HTTPS URL is only available for certified servers. Provide the certification path and the key path using `-tls-cert` and `-tls-key` respectively. The HTTPS port can be changed using the `-https` option.

### Example

```sh
    ./woole-server \
        -tls-cert "/etc/tls/domain/fullchain.pem" \
        -tls-key "/etc/tls/domain/privkey.pem"
```

## Server Authentication

To use the server authentication, generate a shared/symmetric key file (no need to have a special format or length) and use the `-shared-key` providing the file path.

### **Example**

1. **Generate any shared key**:

   ```sh
   openssl rand 32 > shared.key
   ```
   - This command generates a pseudo random 32 bytes binary key.

2. **Usage**:

   Use the same key file in the server and client application:
   ```
   ./woole -shared-key "/path/to/file/shared/key"
   ./woole-server -shared-key "/path/to/file/shared/key"
   ```
