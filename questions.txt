yes - should I just use the URL in the buttons of the redirect????
should the replay send the request to the server instead of send directly????
workaround, reset every recconection - fix serverId bug when reconnecting with another server, send the sequential????
yes - use logic to see if the URL is the same or not to determine whether the button is active or not.
no need, not now - do the wooleParam in a way that stop working when the session changes cryptography?
